In R, a matrix is a collection of elements of the same data type (numeric, character, or logical) arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns. Since you are only working with rows and columns, a matrix is called two-dimensional.

```{r}
# Construct a matrix with 3 rows that contain the numbers
# 1 up to 9
matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)
```



In the editor, three vectors are defined. Each one represents the box office numbers from the first three Star Wars movies. The first element of each vector indicates the US box office revenue, the second element refers to the Non-US box office (source: Wikipedia).

```{r}
# Box office Star Wars (in millions!)
new_hope <- c(460.998, 314.4)
empire_strikes <- c(290.475, 247.900)
return_jedi <- c(309.306, 165.8)

# Create box_office
box_office <- c(new_hope, empire_strikes, return_jedi)

# Construct star_wars_matrix
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(box_office, byrow=TRUE, nrow=3)

star_wars_matrix
```

To help you remember what is stored in star_wars_matrix, you would like to add the names of the movies for the rows. Not only does this help you to read the data, but it is also useful to select certain elements from the matrix.

Similar to vectors, you can add names for the rows and the columns of a matrix

rownames(my_matrix) <- row_names_vector
colnames(my_matrix) <- col_names_vector

```{r}
# Box office Star Wars (in millions!)
new_hope <- c(460.998, 314.4)
empire_strikes <- c(290.475, 247.900)
return_jedi <- c(309.306, 165.8)

# Construct matrix
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(c(new_hope, empire_strikes, return_jedi), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# Vectors region and titles, used for naming
region <- c("US", "non-US")
titles <- c("A New Hope", "The Empire Strikes Back", "Return of the Jedi")

# Name the columns with region
colnames(star_wars_matrix) <- region

# Name the rows with titles
rownames(star_wars_matrix) <- titles

# Print out the star_wars_matrix
star_wars_matrix

```

To calculate the total box office revenue for the three Star Wars movies, you have to take the sum of the US revenue column and the non-US revenue column.

In R, the function rowSums() conveniently calculates the totals for each row of a matrix. This function creates a new vector:

```{r}
# Calculate worldwide box office figures
worldwide_vector <- rowSums(star_wars_matrix)
worldwide_vector
```

You can add a column or multiple columns to a matrix with the cbind() function, which merges matrices and/or vectors together by column. For example:

```{r}
# Bind the new variable worldwide_vector as a column to star_wars_matrix
all_wars_matrix <- cbind(star_wars_matrix, worldwide_vector)
all_wars_matrix
```

```{r}
# Box office Star Wars 2 (in millions!)
phantom_menace <- c(474.5, 552.5)
attack_of_clones <- c(310.7, 338.7)
revenge_of_sith <- c(380.3, 468.5)

# Construct matrix
star_wars_matrix2 <- matrix(c(phantom_menace, attack_of_clones, revenge_of_sith), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# Vectors region and titles, used for naming
region <- c("US", "non-US")
titles <- c("The Phantom Menace", "Attack of the Clones", "Revenge of the Sith")

# Name the columns with region
colnames(star_wars_matrix2) <- region

# Name the rows with titles
rownames(star_wars_matrix2) <- titles

# Print out the star_wars_matrix
star_wars_matrix2
```


Adding a row
Just like every action has a reaction, every cbind() has an rbind().

```{r}
# Combine both Star Wars trilogies in one matrix
all_wars_matrix <- rbind(star_wars_matrix, star_wars_matrix2)
all_wars_matrix
```

Just like cbind() has rbind(), colSums() has rowSums(). Your R workspace already contains the all_wars_matrix that you constructed in the previous exercise; type all_wars_matrix to have another look. Let's now calculate the total box office revenue for the entire saga.

```{r}
# Total revenue for US and non-US
total_revenue_vector <- colSums(all_wars_matrix)
total_revenue_vector
```

Similar to vectors, you can use the square brackets [ ] to select one or multiple elements from a matrix. Whereas vectors have one dimension, matrices have two dimensions. You should therefore use a comma to separate the rows you want to select from the columns. For example:

my_matrix[1,2] selects the element at the first row and second column.
my_matrix[1:3,2:4] results in a matrix with the data on the rows 1, 2, 3 and columns 2, 3, 4.
If you want to select all elements of a row or a column, no number is needed before or after the comma, respectively:

my_matrix[,1] selects all elements of the first column.
my_matrix[1,] selects all elements of the first row.

```{r}
# Select the non-US revenue for all movies
non_use_all <- all_wars_matrix[, 2]

# Average non-US revenue
mean(non_use_all)

# Select the non-US revenue for the first two movies
non_us_some <- all_wars_matrix[1:2, 2]

# Average non-US revenue for first two movies
mean(non_us_some)

```

Similar to what you have learned with vectors, the standard operators like +, -, /, *, etc. work in an element-wise way on matrices in R.

For example, 2 * my_matrix multiplies each element of my_matrix by two.

```{r}
# Estimate the visitors
visitors <- all_wars_matrix / 100
  
# Print the estimate to the console
visitors
```
