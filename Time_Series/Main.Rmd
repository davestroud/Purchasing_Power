Explore the famous River Nile annual streamflow data

The most common first step when conducting time series analysis is to display your time series dataset in a visually intuitive format. The most useful way to view raw time series data in R is to use the print() command, which displays the Start, End, and Frequency of your data along with the observations.

Another useful command for viewing time series data in R is the length() function, which tells you the total number of observations in your data.

```{r}
# Print the Nile dataset
print(Nile)

# List the number of observations in the Nile dataset
length(Nile)

# Display the first 10 elements of the Nile dataset
head(Nile, n = 10)

# Display the last 12 elements of the Nile dataset
tail(Nile, n = 12)
```
