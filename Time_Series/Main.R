  Explore the famous River Nile annual streamflow data


# Print the Nile dataset
print(Nile)

# List the number of observations in the Nile dataset
length(Nile)

# Display the first 10 elements of the Nile dataset
head(Nile, n = 10)

# Display the last 12 elements of the Nile dataset
tail(Nile, n = 12)
```

# Plot the Nile data
plot(Nile)

# Plot the Nile data with xlab and ylab arguments
plot(Nile, xlab = "Year", ylab = "River Volume (1e9 m^{3})")

# Plot the Nile data with xlab, ylab, main, and type arguments
plot(Nile, xlab = "Year", ylab = "River Volume (1e9 m^{3})", main = "Annual River Nile Volume at Aswan, 1871-1970", type ="b")




The start() and end() functions return the time index of the first and last observations, respectively. The time() function calculates a vector of time indices, with one element for each time index on which the series was observed.

The deltat() function returns the fixed time interval between observations and the frequency() function returns the number of observations per unit time. Finally, the cycle() function returns the position in the cycle of each observation.


# Plot AirPassengers
plot(AirPassengers)

# View the start and end dates of AirPassengers
start(AirPassengers)
end(AirPassengers)

# Use time(), deltat(), frequency(), and cycle() with AirPassengers 
time(AirPassengers)
deltat(AirPassengers)
frequency(AirPassengers)
cycle(AirPassengers)





# Plot the AirPassengers data
plot(AirPassengers)

# Compute the mean of AirPassengers
mean(AirPassengers, na.rm = TRUE)

# Impute mean values to NA in AirPassengers
AirPassengers[85:96] <- mean(AirPassengers, na.rm = TRUE)

# Generate another plot of AirPassengers
plot(AirPassengers)

# Add the complete AirPassengers data to your plot
rm(AirPassengers)
points(AirPassengers, type = "l", col = 2, lty = 3)
